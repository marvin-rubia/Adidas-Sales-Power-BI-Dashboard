## I wrote a blog about this
Here is the link to my article: [5 Lessons from Creating Adidas Sales Dashboard in Power BI](https://marvinrubia.medium.com/5-lessons-from-creating-adidas-sales-dashboard-in-power-bi-85caf62253c2).

_--Snippet from the article--_

__Lesson 1: Plan your message__

Due to fiscal considerations, companies publish their net income statement (which includes sales) quarterly and annually. So, I was quite surprised to see some dashboards for the same dataset that present Adidas sales from 2020 to 2021 (a two-year snapshot).

In my case, I want to summarize the sales performance of the North American segment in 2021 only. In this regard, I have to load only the 2021 data in Power BI. Hence, our slicers will readily give the desired 2021 data subset filtered in our visuals.

My dashboard should answer the following key questions.

a. In what period were the sales and profits strong and weak?

b. Which retailers performed best and weakest?

c. Which product performed best and weakest?

d. What selling method was the most and least profitable?

A speaker writes and plans his speech to deliver impact. Similarly, a data storyteller plans his dashboard to show meaningful insights that support or recommend the right business decisions.
